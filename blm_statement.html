				<br>
				<p style="margin-left: 26%; margin-right: 26%; text-align: left; color: black;">As an organization founded to serve the engineering community, our commitment to the wellbeing of all - regardless of color, class, creed, gender, sexual identity, etc. - is unwavering. Words can simply not describe the outrage and pain we feel regarding the tragic events of <strong style="font-weight: bold"> Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, </strong> and
				<strong style="font-weight: bold">George Floyd. </strong> They are not the only ones who have died in a senseless manner - countless Black Americans have suffered at the hands of an unjust system. <br> <br> <br>

We stand in solidarity with members of the Black community, who are 2.5 times more likely to be shot and killed by police officers*. We stand in solidarity with Black womxn and Black members of the LGBTQ+ community, who face alarmingly high rates of hate crimes and police violence**. We stand in solidarity with our fellow Black engineers and scientists, who are underrepresented and only comprise 5% of workers in STEM occupations***. <br> <br> <br>

Systemic change begins with deliberate reflection. We encourage you to take <strong style="font-weight: bold"> 8 minutes and 46 seconds </strong> of silence to contemplate the final words of George Floyd: <strong style="font-weight: bold">“I can’t breathe”. </strong> <br> <br> <br>

In addition, we want to encourage you to stay informed with reputable news sources and first-hand accounts. We urge you to use your voice, your vote, your resources, and any privileges you may have to uplift our marginalized community members and bring light to issues within the broken system. <br> <br> <br>
